## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Project

Clone this repository:
\`\`\`
git clone git@github.com:jsam07/bag-it.git
\`\`\`

### 2. Open in Visual Studio Preview 2022

In order to run the MAUI application locally, you'll need to install **the latest version of** Visual Studio Preview 2022 (.NET MAUI Preview 14) with the following workloads:
  - Mobile development with .NET
  - Universal Windows Platform development
  - Desktop development with C++
  - .NET Desktop Development
  - NET and web development (required for Blazor Desktop and the BlazorWebView control)

*Note*: this is important since .NET MAUI is still in preview, breaking changes could occur if this is not done.

Once VS Preview is configured, you can run the app in \`Debug mode\`, using either one of the  pre-installed \`Android Emulators\` or \`Windows Machine\` option. See below.

1. Build the release version of BagIt via the command: \`dotnet publish -f:net6.0-android -c:Release -o Publish\`
    - The signed apk can then be found in \`Publish/com.companyname.bagit-Signed.apk\`
